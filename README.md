**Ever been deep in a cave, mining away with your trusty enchanted pickaxe, only to have it break on you at the worst possible moment?** Yeah, we’ve all been there. You were sure it had enough durability left, but suddenly—*bam*—it’s gone. The worst part? You didn’t even see it coming.

Well, now you don’t have to worry about that anymore. **Introducing Safe Tools**, the mod that keeps your tools and weapons safe when they’re on the brink of breaking. You can keep digging, fighting, and adventuring without that nagging fear of losing your gear right when you need it the most.

Here’s how it works: **Safe Tools** knows when your tool or weapon is about to give up, and it stops you from accidentally breaking it. No more throwing your favorite enchanted item in the trash because you didn’t realize it was one hit away from destruction. With **Safe Tools**, you’ll get a heads-up before it’s too late.

**What makes Safe Tools awesome?**
- **No more surprise tool breaks!** It kicks in when your gear’s durability is low and keeps you from losing it in a critical moment.
- **Super easy to use.** Just toggle it on or off with a keypress (V by default), and you’re all set.
- **Focus on the fun.** Whether you're fighting mobs, exploring, or mining, **Safe Tools** keeps your gear intact so you can focus on what really matters.

Next time you’re about to go on a mining spree or tackle a big boss, don’t worry about that durability bar. **Safe Tools** has your back, keeping your favorite tools and weapons safe from the inevitable.
